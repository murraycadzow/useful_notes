# useful_notes
A collection of useful tidbits to improve my workflows


This will be a collation of the various bits of knowledge that I have found from wanting to do particular things, mostly from stack overflow

They will likely fall into the following categories

- R
- Bash
- Git

Suggestions/pull requests welcome
